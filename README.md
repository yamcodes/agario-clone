**The easily tweakable clone for modders, developers and .io games enthusiasts of any level!**
💪  
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;🔴 **Accurate:** true to the feel of the game.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;🟠 **Customizable:** configure all aspects of the game.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;🟡 **Fun:** create cool new mods in seconds.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;🟢 **Extendable:** add any mod imaginable.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;🔵 **Feature rich:** has most of agar.io's features.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;🟣 **Easy:** use [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to add features in minutes.  


## 🎯 Project Goals

* Provide a simple framework to allow rapidly implementing new Agar.io features. 
* Teach how to create [io games](https://www.addictinggames.com/what-are-io-games) and how to work with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and JavaScript in general.
* Be highly tweakable and inspire creation of new games.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 0. Prerequisites
- [Node.js v17.4.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v17.4.0/) - the version which this project was created and tested on.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - a package manager aimed at stability.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - for cloning this repository.
- A terminal set up in your projects folder to clone and run this project.

### Step 1. Download

```
git clone https://github.com/yamyam263/agario-clone.git
```

Alternatively, you can use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), or [Download ZIP](https://github.com/starship/starship/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

### Step 2. Install

```
cd agario-clone
yarn
```

### Step 3. Run

```
yarn start
```

✔️ You're done! Head over to `localhost:3000` on your browser to play the game!

## 🛠️ Configuration & Tweaking

Head over to `config/settings.json` using your favorite editor (for example: [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac). Start tweaking! Upon finishing step 3 of the setup, your terminal should be listening to any changes you make. Just hit save and test your changes on `localhost:3000` - there is no need to refresh.
